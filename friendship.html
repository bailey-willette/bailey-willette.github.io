<H1>Importance of Friendship</H1> 

<p>Friends are the backbone to my soul. They pick me up when I am down, they give me endless 
happiness and have already made for a lifetime of memories. The close friends are the ones you
can tell anything to them that you do not feel comfortable saying to anyone else, and they give 
you advice on certain decisions you have to make. Just make sure you do not pick the wrong friends,
as I will give you some indicators from experience of how to differentiate between the two types 
of friends you can have.
</p> 

Indicators of a good friend:
<UL>
<LI>Want to better yourself</LI>
<LI>They are always there for you no matter what</LI>
<LI>They give you encouragement</LI>
</UL>


Indicators of a not so good friend:
<UL>
<LI>Take advantage of you</LI>
<LI>They seem to leave when you need them the most</LI>
<LI>They act different around you when there are other people around</LI>
</UL>

<p>Just some things to keep in mind from my experience so far, because you will have 
friendships (I hope) till the day you will die!
