<H1>My Music</H1> 

<p>Music is a way for me to cope with the various events going on around me. Wether it 
be me studying for a test, in the car with my friends, or just sitting at home thinking 
about life. Music is a gateway to your emotions and different genres or songs in general 
can touch each spot.
</p> 
	
<p>
Most people listen to one type of genre of music, but I like to listen to all kinds of genres.
For example, when my friends and I are in the car, we bump to hip hop/ rap songs, but say I'm 
just chilling at home, I like more mellow rock songs or even pop. Below is a list of various 
artists/bands I like to listen to:
</p>
<UL>
<LI>Drake (Hip Hop/ Rap)
<span class="title special">
</LI> 
<LI>The Fray (Rock)</LI>
<LI>The Red Hot Chilli Peppers (Rock)</LI>
<LI>Lil Uzi Vert (Rap)</LI>
</UL> 

<p>I decided to put this on my website because music is something that will always be with
me and as I get older, the music will evolve as well and I think that is pretty cool. I enjoy 
going to concerts as well, and wish to go to some when I am older to see how much they evolved 
so I could tell my kids someday when I have a family of my own. Plus, songs hold memories, and that 
is a way I can remember funny or great past times when I hear a throwback on the radio once I get old.
