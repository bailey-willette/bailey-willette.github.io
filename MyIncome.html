<H1> My Income</H1>

<p>Ever since I was a little child, I always seemed to like to make money. I used to make bets
with my parents to try and earn money and set up lemonade stands in the summer as a way to 
make extra money as well. I feel like I have always had that grind mentality to make money, and 
believe that is why I am currently in the business school at UMaine. 
</p> 

<p>My first real job was about three years ago at a local ice cream parlor. I worked every 
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Sundays and was making a decent amount of money. I enjoyed it
for a little while but then I got bored of it so I quit last summer. I saved up a lot of money 
and bought the car that I have now, which is a Volkswagen CC.
</p>

<p>My current flow of income comes from a local golf country club called MCC. You can find the
link here

. I work as a caddy for the members that golf there and get tips quite often (Most of my pay 
comes from the tips because everyone is loaded that goes there). It is quite an easy job, and 
the fact that I love and play golf myself makes this job that much less stressful. This is where 
I am at right now in terms of my flow of income. I only work at this place, so I do not have
a job at the moment, not until summer break.
