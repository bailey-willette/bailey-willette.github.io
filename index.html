<p> Hello, welcome to my webpage! I am currently a student at the University of Maine, undeclared in Business. 
I enjoy chilling with my friends, listening to music and making money. The links below will lead to the 
importance of friendship, the types of music I like to listen to and my sources of income at the moment 
in my career.
